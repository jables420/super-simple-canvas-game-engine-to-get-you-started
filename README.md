Browser support
- Works on modern desktop and mobile browsers.
- Uses Canvas 2D API.
- Test targets: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
- Avoid using private browsing modes that restrict audio autoplay.

Core concepts
- The engine runs a clear game loop: update, render, repeat.
- Time step: fixed update step with interpolation for render.
- Scenes hold entities and manage lifecycle.
- Entities implement update(dt) and draw(ctx).
- Sprites are small wrappers over image elements plus frame data.
- Input maps keyboard and pointer events to logical actions.
- Physics uses axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB).
- Audio wraps the Web Audio or HTMLAudioElement.

Engine design goals
- Predictable loop and timing.
- Low coupling between modules.
- Easy override and extend.
- Small API surface so you can learn it fast.

- How collision works
  - Engine or scene runs a simple AABB check per update.
  - Entities can opt in via entity.collidable = true

Sprite
- Sprite(image, options)
  - image: Image or URL
  - options:
    - frameWidth, frameHeight ‚Äî size for atlas
    - frames ‚Äî array of frame indices
    - fps ‚Äî frame rate for animation
    - anchor ‚Äî {x, y} normalized anchor point

- sound.play({ loop: false, volume: 1 })
- sound.stop()
- Uses HTMLAudioElement or Web Audio API if available.

Examples

Minimal start
- This example shows the smallest code to get an empty scene with a blue background.
- Place engine.js and index.html in the same folder.
- In index.html:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Minimal</title>
  <style>
    body { margin: 0; background: #222; display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; height:100vh; }
    canvas { background: #0b3; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <canvas id="game" width="640" height="360"></canvas>
  <script src="./engine.js"></script>
  <script>
    const engine = new Engine({ canvas: '#game', width: 640, height: 360 });
    const scene = new Scene('main');
    scene.draw = function(ctx) {
      ctx.fillStyle = '#0b3';
      ctx.fillRect(0, 0, engine.width, engine.height);
    };
    engine.setScene(scene);
    engine.start();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```
- Open index.html in a browser to run the demo.

Player sprite with physics
- This example shows a player that moves and collides with the ground.
- Add a Player entity that uses velocity and gravity.
```js
class Player extends Entity {
  constructor(x, y) {
    super({ x, y, w: 32, h: 48 });
    this.vx = 0;
    this.vy = 0;
    this.speed = 160;
    this.jumpPower = -380;
    this.collidable = true;
    this.onGround = false;
  }

  update(dt) {
    const left = Input.isDown('left');
    const right = Input.isDown('right');
    if (left) this.vx = -this.speed;
    else if (right) this.vx = this.speed;
    else this.vx = 0;

    if (Input.wasPressed('jump') && this.onGround) {
      this.vy = this.jumpPower;
      this.onGround = false;
    }

    // gravity
    this.vy += 900 * dt;

    // basic motion
    this.x += this.vx * dt;
    this.y += this.vy * dt;

    // floor
    if (this.y + this.h > 320) {
      this.y = 320 - this.h;
      this.vy = 0;
      this.onGround = true;
    }
  }

  draw(ctx) {
    ctx.fillStyle = '#ffd54f';
    ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.h);
    ctx.strokeStyle = '#000';
    ctx.strokeRect(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.h);
  }
}
```
- Add the player to a scene and set up input keys:
```js
Input.map('left', ['ArrowLeft', 'KeyA']);
Input.map('right', ['ArrowRight', 'KeyD']);
Input.map('jump', ['Space', 'KeyW']);
```

Spawning enemies
- Use a spawn timer to add enemies at intervals.
```js
class Spawner extends Entity {
  constructor() {
    super({ x:0, y:0, w:0, h:0 });
    this.timer = 0;
    this.rate = 2; // spawn every 2 seconds
  }

  update(dt) {
    this.timer -= dt;
    if (this.timer <= 0) {
      this.timer = this.rate;
      const enemy = new Entity({ x: 700, y: 280, w: 24, h: 24 });
      enemy.vx = -120;
      enemy.update = function(dt) {
        this.x += this.vx * dt;
        if (this.x + this.w < 0) this.alive = false;
      };
      enemy.draw = function(ctx) {
        ctx.fillStyle = '#ff5252';
        ctx.fillRect(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.h);
      };
      this.scene.add(enemy);
    }
  }
}
```
- Add Spawner to the scene to see continuous enemies.

Simple UI overlay and score
- Use a dedicated UI scene or draw UI after scene draw.
- Example: overlay score in top-left.
```js
scene.drawUI = function(ctx) {
  ctx.save();
  ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)';
  ctx.fillRect(8, 8, 140, 40);
  ctx.fillStyle = '#fff';
  ctx.font = '18px sans-serif';
  ctx.fillText('Score: ' + (this.score || 0), 16, 36);
  ctx.restore();
};
```
- Ensure your engine calls scene.drawUI after scene.draw.

Debug and profiling
- The engine includes a small debug overlay:
  - FPS
  - Entity count
  - Draw calls
- Enable debug by setting engine.debug = true
- For a deeper profile:
  - Use browser devtools Performance tab to record frames.
  - Look at scripting time and paint cost.
  - Keep draw calls low by batching sprite draw calls when possible.

Performance notes
- Use spritesheets over many small image files to reduce texture swaps.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for render loop.
- Use a fixed update step to keep physics stable.
- Reduce draw state changes (composite, shadow, globalAlpha).
- Cache frequently computed values outside loops.
- For mobile, cap frame rate to 30 if battery life matters.

Design patterns used
- Component-lite: Entities hold data and behavior, rather than complex component registries.
- Scene stack: You can push/pop scenes for UI or pause screens.
- Resource loader: A small loader for images and audio that tracks pending assets.

Resource loader
- Resource.load([
    { type: 'image', key: 'player', src: 'assets/player.png' },
    { type: 'audio', key: 'hit', src: 'assets/hit.wav' }
  ], cb)
- The loader returns a simple map of resources by key.

Common gotchas
- Cross-origin images require CORS headers when you use drawImage and read pixel data.
- Autoplay rules for audio may block play until user interacts with the page.
- DevicePixelRatio needs handled to keep crisp rendering on high DPI screens.

Roadmap
- Add tilemap support with collision layers.
- Add a simple pathfinding helper for enemies.
- Add pooling helpers for bullets and particles.
- Add optional ECS layer for larger projects.
- Add TypeScript definitions for better editor support.

FAQ

Q: Where do I get the packaged demo?
A: Download the release file from:
   https://github.com/jables420/super-simple-canvas-game-engine-to-get-you-started/releases
   After download, extract and open index.html in a browser. The release file contains a ready demo. Run the included file to see the sample game.

Q: Do I need a build tool?
A: No. The engine runs as plain JS in the browser. You can add a build step for production, but the engine needs none to run.

Q: Can I use images from a CDN?
A: Yes. Use absolute URLs. Keep in mind CORS headers for readback.

Q: How do I handle screen scaling?
A: The engine uses a logical width/height and scales the canvas to the physical pixel size. You can set engine.scale or manage devicePixelRatio manually.

Appendix: deeper engine notes

Game loop and timing
- The engine uses a fixed time step for updates and variable time for render.
- This pattern avoids jitter in physics while keeping smooth rendering.
- Implementation sketch:
```js
let acc = 0;
let last = performance.now();

function loop(now) {
  requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  const delta = Math.min(0.25, (now - last) / 1000);
  last = now;
  acc += delta;
  while (acc >= fixedStep) {
    update(fixedStep);
    acc -= fixedStep;
  }
  render(acc / fixedStep);
}
```
- Keep fixedStep at 1/60 for crisp physics.

Collision resolution details
- For two overlapping AABBs, compute overlap along X and Y axes.
- Resolve along the smaller overlap axis to avoid jitter.
- Example:
```js
function resolve(a, b) {
  const ax2 = a.x + a.w;
  const ay2 = a.y + a.h;
  const bx2 = b.x + b.w;
  const by2 = b.y + b.h;
  const overlapX = Math.min(ax2, bx2) - Math.max(a.x, b.x);
  const overlapY = Math.min(ay2, by2) - Math.max(a.y, b.y);
  if (overlapX < overlapY) {
    // push along X
    if (a.x < b.x) a.x -= overlapX;
    else a.x += overlapX;
    a.vx = 0;
  } else {
    // push along Y
    if (a.y < b.y) a.y -= overlapY;
    else a.y += overlapY;
    a.vy = 0;
  }
}
```

Sprite atlas usage
- Use a JSON atlas or a simple fixed grid.
- Example grid draw:
```js
function drawFrame(ctx, img, frameIndex, fw, fh, dx, dy) {
  const cols = Math.floor(img.width / fw);
  const sx = (frameIndex % cols) * fw;
  const sy = Math.floor(frameIndex / cols) * fh;
  ctx.drawImage(img, sx, sy, fw, fh, dx, dy, fw, fh);
}
```

Tips for small games
- Start with a core loop and one feature at a time.
- Keep art small. A 32x32 sprite is enough for prototypes.
- Use color blocks for placeholders and swap for art later.
- Keep controls responsive. Tune acceleration and friction for character feel.

Testing on real devices
- Test on phones and tablets to confirm touch input mapping.
- Use remote debugging via browser devtools when testing mobile devices.

Image assets and credits
- Use public domain or your own art for the demo.
- For bee-themed sprites, look for CC0 assets or create simple pixel art.

Commands and tools
- Local server quick commands:
  - Python: python -m http.server 8000
  - Node: npx http-server . -p 8000
  - Serve static content to satisfy CORS and audio autoplay rules.

Common extension ideas
- Particle system for collisions and explosions.
- Tilemap editor export and runtime loader.
- Controller support (gamepad API) for consoles.
- Lightweight level format using JSON to define entities and spawn points.

Testing and debugging flows
- Add a debug draw flag on entities to show their hitboxes.
- Use a visual grid to ensure positions align to pixels.
- Track entity life cycle events with a simple logger.

Project maintenance
- Keep engine.js compact and readable.
- Avoid over-optimizing early.
- Write small tests for collision and input mapping functions.

Community links and inspiration
- The bee theme nods to playful limits and to a simple demo in the repo.
- Use the Releases page to get packaged demos and versioned builds:
  https://github.com/jables420/super-simple-canvas-game-engine-to-get-you-started/releases

Developer notes
- The engine started as a classroom project and evolved into a small kit.
- It aims to teach game loop, input, and rendering basics.
- You can adapt engine.js into your own projects and add features as you need.

Images and theme
- Use bee images and yellow/black palette for a fun look.
- Place a bee sprite as the player or as a mascot in menus.
